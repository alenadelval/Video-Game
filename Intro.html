  <h1> Addicted to the Violence </h1>
  <h2> Terms and Agreements </h2>
  <h3> You are addicted to the violence. We live in a world where acts of terror and violence have become something that no longer shocks us. To escape it, you turn on your computer, pull out your phone, or turn on a console, and launch into a game. But what does this “digital escape” actually provide? </h3>
 <h3>
Addicted to the Violence is a catalogue that addresses how videogames use violence for entertainment despite the seemingly fantasy escape world they provide. While video games used to be limited to consoles and computer games, the rise of smartphones as well as small portable handhelds in the 21st century have allowed people to play videogames not only in their own home but in public settings to allow for quick entertainment. However, these fantasy worlds are not as harmless as individuals make them out to be. From the controversy that video games make people more violent, to promoting domestic abuse, video games have been under fire for the negative impact they have on the human psyche. This interactive catalogue will address three key forms of violence that exist in both the “real” world as well as the digital one: violence towards women, violence towards race, and violence towards your mind. </h3>
